# PDF Generation and Upload Integration Testing Guide

This guide explains how to use the PDF integration test script to verify that all PDF-related functionality works correctly after deployment or code changes.

## Overview

The `test-pdf-integration.js` script verifies the following functionality:

1. PDF generation using the `/api/generate-pdf` endpoint
2. Supabase storage bucket access and fallback mechanism
3. PDF upload to Supabase storage
4. Direct PDF attachment to Airtable records
5. Verification of Airtable attachments

## Prerequisites

Before running the tests, you need:

- Node.js installed (v14 or later recommended)
- Your project dependencies installed via `npm install`
- Access to your Supabase project
- Access to your Airtable base
- A valid Airtable record ID for attachment testing (optional but recommended)

## Installation

1. Make sure the test-pdf-integration.js file exists in your project root
2. Install the required dependencies if not already present:

```bash
npm install dotenv node-fetch @supabase/supabase-js airtable
```

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in your project root with the following variables:

```
# API URL - use localhost for local testing or your deployed URL
API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Supabase credentials (same as in your main .env file)
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key

# Airtable credentials (same as in your main .env file)
AIRTABLE_API_KEY=your-airtable-api-key
AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=your-airtable-base-id

# Test-specific configuration
# An existing Airtable transaction record ID to test attachments with
# Leave blank to skip Airtable attachment tests
TEST_RECORD_ID=rec123456789
```

## Running the Tests

1. Start your development server if testing locally:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. In a separate terminal, run the test script:
   ```bash
   node test-pdf-integration.js
   ```

3. Review the test output in the console, which will show:
   - PDF generation status
   - Supabase bucket availability
   - Upload success or failure
   - Airtable attachment status
   - Verification of attachments on the Airtable record

## Interpreting Results

The test script uses emojis to indicate success (✅), warnings (⚠️), and errors (❌):

- ✅ - Test passed successfully
- ⚠️ - Potential issue or skipped test (with reason)
- ❌ - Test failed (with error details)

## Troubleshooting

If tests fail, check the following:

### PDF Generation Issues
- Ensure your API server is running
- Check that the API_BASE_URL is correct
- Verify that the `/api/generate-pdf` endpoint is accessible

### Supabase Issues
- Confirm your Supabase credentials are correct
- Verify that the project has at least one storage bucket
- Check permissions on the bucket (should allow uploads)

### Airtable Issues
- Verify your Airtable API key and base ID
- Ensure the TEST_RECORD_ID exists in your Transactions table
- Check that the field ID for PDF attachments matches your schema

## Production Testing

To test against your production environment:

1. Update the `API_BASE_URL` in your `.env` file to point to your production URL:
   ```
   API_BASE_URL=https://your-production-url.vercel.app
   ```

2. Run the test script as usual:
   ```bash
   node test-pdf-integration.js
   ```

## Advanced Usage

### Testing Specific Components

You can modify the script to test only specific parts of the integration:

```javascript
async function runSpecificTests() {
  // Test only PDF generation
  const pdfData = await testPdfGeneration();
  
  // Or test only Supabase buckets
  await testSupabaseBuckets();
}

// Replace runTests() with your custom function
runSpecificTests();
```

### Adding Custom Tests

You can extend the test script to cover additional functionality by adding new test functions and including them in the `runTests()` function.
