# Artistic Transaction Form

This is an enhanced version of the standard Transaction Form, transformed into an art piece while maintaining full functionality.

## Features

- ðŸŽ¨ **Artistically Styled UI**: Beautiful gradients, animations, and thoughtful design elements that elevate the form experience
- ðŸ”„ **Toggle Between Standard and Artistic Views**: Use the floating button to switch between the standard business form and the artistic version
- âœ¨ **Enhanced User Experience**: Engaging animations, micro-interactions, and visual feedback
- ðŸ“± **Fully Responsive**: Works beautifully on all device sizes
- ðŸŽ¯ **Maintains Full Functionality**: All validation, data handling, and submission logic works exactly the same as the standard form

## Components

The artistic form system includes:

1. `ArtisticTransactionForm.tsx` - The main artistic form component
2. `ArtisticStepWizard.tsx` - A reimagined step indicator with animations
3. `ArtisticSignatureSection.tsx` - An enhanced signature experience with particle effects
4. `ArtisticForm.css` - Custom styling that transforms the form into an art piece
5. `FormArtToggle.tsx` - Component to toggle between standard and artistic views

## Usage

### Basic Usage

To use the artistic form toggle (which allows users to switch between standard and artistic views):

```jsx
import { FormArtToggle } from '@/components/TransactionForm';

export default function TransactionPage() {
  return <FormArtToggle defaultArtistic={true} />;
}
```

### Using Only the Artistic Form

If you want to use just the artistic form without the toggle:

```jsx
import { ArtisticTransactionForm } from '@/components/TransactionForm';

export default function ArtisticTransactionPage() {
  return <ArtisticTransactionForm />;
}
```

## Design Philosophy

The artistic form was designed with the following principles:

1. **Beauty with Purpose**: Every visual enhancement serves a functional purpose
2. **Emotional Connection**: Creating a more engaging and memorable experience for users
3. **Attention to Detail**: Subtle animations, micro-interactions, and transitions that delight
4. **Inspiration from Fine Art**: Use of golden ratios, classical compositions, and artistic color palettes
5. **Balanced Aesthetics**: Striking the right balance between artistic expression and usability

## Technical Implementation

- Uses Framer Motion for smooth animations
- Implements custom CSS with carefully crafted gradients and transitions
- Employs a responsive design system that adapts to any screen size
- Creates particle effects for the signature component

## Customization
