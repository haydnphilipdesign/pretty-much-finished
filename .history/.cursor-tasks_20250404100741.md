## In Progress Tasks
- [ ] Update useTransactionForm hook to handle new components (moderate)
- [ ] Fix role selection display (initializing at step 0 instead of step 1)
- [ ] Test cover sheet generation with various agent roles and form data (moderate)
- [ ] Set up email service configuration for production deployment (simple)

## Planned Tasks
- [ ] Add validation for all form sections (complex)
- [ ] Improve PDF styling and layout (moderate)
- [ ] Implement form submission to backend (moderate)
- [ ] Add mobile-responsive design (moderate)
- [ ] Create SuccessModal component (simple)
- [ ] Implement data persistence between sessions (moderate)
- [ ] Add automated tests for form functionality (complex)
- [ ] Expand field mappings for cover sheet generation (moderate)
- [ ] Add error logging for PDF generation (simple)
- [ ] Create admin interface for viewing cover sheet email status (moderate)

## Project Structure
- `src/components/TransactionForm/` - Main form components
- `src/hooks/useTransactionForm.ts` - State management hook
- `src/types/transaction.ts` - Type definitions
- `src/utils/validation.ts` - Form validation utilities
- `src/utils/coverSheetGenerator.ts` - Cover sheet generation utilities
- `src/utils/airtable.ts` - Airtable integration and form submission
- `src/utils/emailUtils.ts` - Email sending utility functions
- `src/components/CoverSheetButton.tsx` - Reusable button component for cover sheet generation
- `src/pages/example-integration.tsx` - Example page demonstrating the cover sheet integration

## Integration Points
- Form submits data to Airtable
- Address autocomplete via Google Places API
- Document storage potentially via AWS S3
- PDF generation in background with email delivery
- Cover sheet templates based on agent role (Buyer, Seller, Dual Agent)
- Email delivery to administration (debbie@parealestatesupport.com)

## Cover Sheet Generation
- Implemented two approaches for PDF generation:
  - Client-side using html2canvas and jsPDF
  - Server-side using Puppeteer
- Created field mappings between Airtable data and HTML elements
- Integrated generation directly into the form submission process
- Added error handling and fallback mechanisms
- PDF files are now emailed directly to administration (debbie@parealestatesupport.com)
- Users receive confirmation but don't interact with the PDF directly

## Notes
- Current implementation blends the existing TransactionForm with enhancements from mercury-coder
- Maintained compatibility with existing form structure and state management
- Added new components: KeyboardNavigation, FormProgressIndicator, enhanced RoleSelection
- Fixed property access duplication issue by removing redundant PropertyAccessSection rendering
- Updated form step progression to start with role selection (step 0)
- Cover sheet generation now happens automatically after successful form submission
- PDFs are generated in the background and emailed to administration without user interaction
- The CoverSheetButton component provides a way to manually trigger PDF generation if needed
- Example integration page demonstrates the complete workflow
- Future work should focus on finalizing validation, improving PDF styling, and expanding field mappings
- Email configuration needs to be set up for production deployment
