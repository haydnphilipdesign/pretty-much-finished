# CSS Consolidation

This document explains the CSS consolidation that was performed to fix text contrast issues and ensure consistent styling throughout the website.

## What Changed

1. **Consolidated CSS Files**: All CSS files have been consolidated into two main files:
   - `src/styles/consolidated.css`
   - `src/styles/consolidated-part2.css`

2. **Simplified Imports**: The main `index.css` file now only imports these consolidated files and the transaction form CSS.

3. **Fixed Text Contrast Issues**: All text now has proper contrast against its background.

4. **Consistent Card Styling**: All glass cards now have consistent styling with proper text contrast.

5. **Consistent Navigation Styling**: Navigation links now have proper contrast in both transparent and scrolled states.

## How to Apply the Changes

1. Run the `apply-consolidated-css.bat` script to apply all changes.
2. Restart your development server to see the changes.

## CSS Structure

The consolidated CSS is organized into the following sections:

### consolidated.css
- Variables
- Base Styles
- Component Styles
- Glass Card System
- Text Contrast Fixes
- Animations
- Custom Scrollbar
- Form Styles
- Loading States
- Focus Styles
- Page Transitions
- Background Styles

### consolidated-part2.css
- Header and Navigation
- Footer Styles
- Section Specific Styles

## Transaction Form CSS

The transaction form CSS has been left untouched as requested. It is imported separately in the main `index.css` file.

## Backup

A backup of the original `index.css` file has been created with the `.backup` extension. If you need to revert the changes, you can simply copy this file back to `index.css`.

## Notes

- The consolidated CSS maintains all the functionality of the original CSS files.
- All text now has proper contrast against its background.
- All glass cards now have consistent styling.
- The navigation links now have proper contrast in both transparent and scrolled states.
- The transaction form CSS has been left untouched.

If you encounter any issues with the consolidated CSS, please refer to the backup files or contact the developer.
