# Transaction Form Implementation Tasks

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Enhance TransactionForm main component with additional features from mercury-coder
- [x] Update RoleSelection component with improved UI
- [x] Create KeyboardNavigation component for improved accessibility
- [x] Update TitleCompanyData interface with additional fields
- [x] Fix linter errors in TransactionForm
- [x] Implement FormProgressIndicator component
- [x] Fix the property access duplication issue
- [x] Update FormNavigation component to handle all steps
- [x] Improve DocumentsSection component
- [x] Implement cover sheet PDF generation functionality
- [x] Create reusable CoverSheetButton component
- [x] Integrate PDF generation with form submission flow
- [x] Create example integration page to demonstrate functionality

## In Progress Tasks
- [ ] Update useTransactionForm hook to handle new components (moderate)
- [ ] Fix role selection display (initializing at step 0 instead of step 1)
- [ ] Test cover sheet generation with various agent roles and form data (moderate)

## Planned Tasks
- [ ] Add validation for all form sections (complex)
- [ ] Improve PDF styling and layout (moderate)
- [ ] Implement form submission to backend (moderate)
- [ ] Add mobile-responsive design (moderate)
- [ ] Create SuccessModal component (simple)
- [ ] Implement data persistence between sessions (moderate)
- [ ] Add automated tests for form functionality (complex)
- [ ] Expand field mappings for cover sheet generation (moderate)
- [ ] Add error logging for PDF generation (simple)

## Project Structure
- `src/components/TransactionForm/` - Main form components
- `src/hooks/useTransactionForm.ts` - State management hook
- `src/types/transaction.ts` - Type definitions
- `src/utils/validation.ts` - Form validation utilities
- `src/utils/coverSheetGenerator.ts` - Cover sheet generation utilities
- `src/utils/airtable.ts` - Airtable integration and form submission
- `src/components/CoverSheetButton.tsx` - Reusable button component for cover sheet generation
- `src/pages/example-integration.tsx` - Example page demonstrating the cover sheet integration

## Integration Points
- Form submits data to Airtable
- Address autocomplete via Google Places API
- Document storage potentially via AWS S3
- PDF generation integrated with form submission
- Cover sheet templates based on agent role (Buyer, Seller, Dual Agent)

## Cover Sheet Generation
- Implemented two approaches for PDF generation:
  - Client-side using html2canvas and jsPDF
  - Server-side using Puppeteer
- Created field mappings between Airtable data and HTML elements
- Integrated generation directly into the form submission process
- Added error handling and fallback mechanisms

## Notes
- Current implementation blends the existing TransactionForm with enhancements from mercury-coder
- Maintained compatibility with existing form structure and state management
- Added new components: KeyboardNavigation, FormProgressIndicator, enhanced RoleSelection
- Fixed property access duplication issue by removing redundant PropertyAccessSection rendering
- Updated form step progression to start with role selection (step 0)
- Cover sheet generation now happens automatically after successful form submission
- The CoverSheetButton component provides a manual fallback for PDF generation
- Example integration page demonstrates the complete workflow
- Future work should focus on finalizing validation, improving PDF styling, and expanding field mappings
