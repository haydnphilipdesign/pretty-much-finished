## Usage Guidelines 
 
When using glass cards, follow these guidelines: 
 
### For Light Backgrounds (white/gray) 
- Use `.glass-card`, `.glass-card-blue`, `.glass-card-navy`, or `.glass-card-dark` 
- These have appropriate contrast adjustments for light backgrounds 
 
### For Dark Backgrounds (blue/navy) 
- Use `.glass-card-white`, `.glass-card-frost`, or `.glass-card-light` 
- These have appropriate contrast adjustments for dark backgrounds 
 
### For Forms 
- Use `.glass-card-frost` which has optimized styling for form elements 
 
### For Accent Areas 
- Use `.glass-card-gold` to draw attention to important content 
 
## Text Styling 
 
All glass card variants have been optimized for text contrast: 
 
- Headings (h1, h2, h3, h4) have appropriate colors and text shadows where needed 
- Paragraphs and other text elements have proper contrast against the card background 
- Form elements (inputs, textareas, selects) have consistent styling with proper contrast 
- Links have appropriate styling and hover states with sufficient contrast 
 
## Helper Classes 
 
The following helper classes are available for consistent content styling: 
 
- `.glass-card-title`: Use for card headings 
- `.glass-card-subtitle`: Use for secondary text below the heading 
- `.glass-card-content`: Use for main content text 
 
## Opacity Control 
 
Adjust the opacity of glass cards using helper classes: 
 
- `.glass-opacity-light` (70% opacity) 
- `.glass-opacity-medium` (85% opacity)  
- `.glass-opacity-heavy` (95% opacity) 
 
## Backup 
 
A backup of the original `index.css` file has been created with the `.backup.[date]` extension. If you need to revert the changes, you can simply copy this file back to `index.css`.
