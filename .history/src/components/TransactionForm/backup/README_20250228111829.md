# Transaction Form - Previous Implementation

This folder contains the previous implementation of the Transaction Form where each section was split into separate components. These files are kept for reference but are no longer actively used in the current implementation.

The current implementation has been consolidated into TransactionForm.tsx with the following active dependencies:
- client/ClientCard.tsx
- client/ClientFormFields.tsx
- context/FormContext.tsx
