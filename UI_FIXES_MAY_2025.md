# UI Fixes - May 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Button Text Contrast Issue
- **Problem:** Button text was the same color as the button background, making it unreadable
- **Solution:** Applied CSS fixes to ensure proper contrast between button text and background
- **Implementation:**
  - Added specific selectors for buttons to force appropriate text color
  - Added `!important` flags to override any conflicting styles
  - Enhanced text with proper font weight for better visibility

### 2. Service Cards Inconsistency in "Elevate Your Real Estate Business" Section
- **Problem:** The four cards had different background colors and didn't visually match each other
- **Solution:** 
  - Modified the ServicesOverview component to use the same card style ("glass-navy") for all cards
  - Added CSS rules to ensure all cards in this section have the same styling regardless of their class
  - Fixed the background color to rgba(15, 28, 46, 0.8) for all cards in this section

### 3. Section Heading Text Contrast Issue
- **Problem:** The "Elevate Your Real Estate Business" heading had poor contrast with the background
- **Solution:**
  - Added CSS rules to ensure the heading is white with appropriate text shadow
  - Enhanced readability with proper font weight and contrast

### 4. Heading Text Same Color as Background
- **Problem:** The "Elevate Your Real Estate Business" main heading had text that was the same color as the background
- **Solution:**
  - Applied a dark navy color (#0F1C2E) to the heading text 
  - Added white text shadow for contrast
  - Increased font weight and letter spacing for better legibility

### 5. "What Our Clients Say" Section Had White Background Box
- **Problem:** The testimonials section heading had an unwanted white background behind it
- **Solution:**
  - Removed the background gradient divs from the Testimonials component
  - Changed the section background to a consistent light blue-gray (#EEF2F6)
  - Made the heading containers transparent

### 6. Contact Cards Not Matching in "Let's Transform Your Business" Section
- **Problem:** The three contact cards used different styles (blue, navy, and frost colors)
- **Solution:**
  - Modified the ContactSection component to use the same card style ("glass-navy") for all three cards
  - Added CSS rules to ensure consistent styling, including text color and shadows
  - Ensured all text within these cards has proper contrast with the background

### 7. "Ready to streamline your transactions?" Text Color Issue
- **Problem:** The text was dark with a shadow effect, making it difficult to read on the blue background
- **Solution:**
  - Changed the text color to white for maximum contrast against the dark blue card background
  - Added enhanced text shadow for better visibility
  - Increased font weight to make the text more prominent

### 8. White Background Issue in "Let's Transform Your Business" Section
- **Problem:** There was a subtle white background container behind the heading text that didn't match the section background
- **Solution:**
  - Removed the gradient background divs from the ContactSection component
  - Set a consistent background color (#f5f7fa) for the entire section
  - Made all containers in this section transparent to eliminate any background inconsistency

## Implementation Details

### CSS Approach
- Created a new CSS file (`src/styles/ui-fixes-may2025.css`) with targeted fixes
- Imported the new CSS file in `index.css`
- Used specific selectors to target only the affected elements

### Component Updates
- Modified the `services` array in `ServicesOverview.tsx` to use consistent card styling
