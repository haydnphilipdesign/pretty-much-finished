## Project Structure
- `src/components/TransactionForm/` - Main form components
- `src/hooks/useTransactionForm.ts` - State management hook
- `src/types/transaction.ts` - Type definitions
- `src/utils/validation.ts` - Form validation utilities
- `src/utils/coverSheetGenerator.ts` - Cover sheet generation utilities
- `src/utils/airtable.ts` - Airtable integration and form submission
- `src/utils/emailUtils.ts` - Email sending utility functions
- `src/utils/test-pdf-generation.ts` - Test script for PDF generation
- `src/components/CoverSheetButton.tsx` - Reusable button component for cover sheet generation
- `src/pages/example-integration.tsx` - Example page demonstrating the cover sheet integration
- `src/components/TransactionForm/TransactionFormWithAutofill.tsx` - Version of the transaction form with autofill functionality
- `scripts/setup-email-config.js` - Interactive script for configuring email settings
- `PDF_TESTING_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive guide for testing PDF generation

## Integration Points
- Form submits data to Airtable
- Address autocomplete via Google Places API
- Document storage potentially via AWS S3
- PDF generation in background with email delivery
- Cover sheet templates based on agent role (Buyer, Seller, Dual Agent)
- Email delivery to administration (debbie@parealestatesupport.com)

## Autofill Functionality
- Added autofill button to RoleSelection component to facilitate testing
- Created TransactionFormWithAutofill as a simplified, decoupled version of the form
- Added routes to access the form with autofill through `/agent-portal/transaction-with-autofill`
- Added navigation buttons from both Home page and Agent Dashboard
- Implemented quick generation of test data for agent role, property details, and clients
- Designed for easy testing without impacting the main transaction form

## Cover Sheet Generation
- Implemented two approaches for PDF generation:
  - Client-side using html2canvas and jsPDF
  - Server-side using Puppeteer
- Created field mappings between Airtable data and HTML elements
- Integrated generation directly into the form submission process
- Added error handling and fallback mechanisms
- PDF files are now emailed directly to administration (debbie@parealestatesupport.com)
- Users receive confirmation but don't interact with the PDF directly

## Testing
- Created a comprehensive test script (`test-pdf-generation.ts`) to verify PDF generation
- Added an email configuration setup script to help users configure email settings
- Created a detailed testing guide with troubleshooting information
- Added npm scripts for running tests and setting up configuration:
  - `npm run test:pdf` - Test PDF generation with dummy data
  - `npm run setup:email` - Configure email settings interactively

## Notes
- Current implementation blends the existing TransactionForm with enhancements from mercury-coder
- Maintained compatibility with existing form structure and state management
- Added new components: KeyboardNavigation, FormProgressIndicator, enhanced RoleSelection
- Fixed property access duplication issue by removing redundant PropertyAccessSection rendering
- Updated form step progression to start with role selection (step 0)
- Cover sheet generation now happens automatically after successful form submission
- PDFs are generated in the background and emailed to administration without user interaction
- The CoverSheetButton component provides a way to manually trigger PDF generation if needed
- Example integration page demonstrates the complete workflow
- Future work should focus on finalizing validation, improving PDF styling, and expanding field mappings
- Email configuration needs to be set up for production deployment
