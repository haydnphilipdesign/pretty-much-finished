# Visual Fixes Documentation

This document outlines the changes made to fix visual issues across the website, ensuring consistent styling, proper text contrast, and improved animations.

## Text Color Contrast Issues

### Problem
There were several instances where text had the same color as the background, making it unreadable. This was especially evident in glass cards and sections with colored backgrounds.

### Solution
1. Created a dedicated `text-contrast-fixes.css` file with comprehensive text color corrections
2. Applied appropriate text colors based on background colors:
   - Light backgrounds: dark text colors
   - Dark/blue backgrounds: light/white text colors
   - Glass cards: properly contrasting text colors based on the card type

## Glass Card Aesthetics

### Problem
Glass cards across the site had inconsistent styling, some with gradient backgrounds that didn't align with the overall site aesthetic.

### Solution
1. Created new enhanced glass card styles in `glass-cards-enhanced.css`
2. Replaced gradient backgrounds with more subtle, consistent glass effects
3. Implemented four main glass card variants:
   - `glass-card-enhanced`: General purpose glass effect
   - `glass-card-white`: For light content on dark backgrounds
   - `glass-card-blue`: For blue-themed content
   - `glass-card-navy`: For white text on dark blue backgrounds

## About Hero Glass Card

### Problem
The glass card in the About page hero section was empty or improperly populated.

### Solution
1. Added explicit `pageType="about"` to the PageHeroWrapper in AboutUs.tsx
2. Updated the getGlassCardContent function to properly populate content based on page type
3. Ensured proper styling and text contrast for the card content

## Animation Consistency

### Problem
The exit animations for hero content looked great, but the entrance animations didn't match them, creating an inconsistent visual experience.

### Solution
1. Made entrance and exit animations symmetrical for hero content:
   - Entrance: fade in + move up
   - Exit: fade out + move up (previously only faded)
2. Ensured consistent animation timings and delays
3. Added exit animations to card elements for smoother page transitions

## Work With Me Page Cards

### Problem
The Work With Me page had cards with gradient backgrounds that didn't match the site's aesthetic.

### Solution
1. Replaced gradient overlays with clean glass-card-navy styles
2. Updated the contact method cards with improved styling
3. Improved the form styling with better contrasting text and input fields

## Home Page CSS

### Problem
The Home page had various styling inconsistencies and text contrast issues.

### Solution
1. Created a dedicated `home-page-fixes.css` file with specific fixes for the Home page
2. Updated the Hero component with consistent animation and styling
3. Applied glass-card-navy to feature cards for better visual consistency
4. Fixed scroll indicator styling to match the design system

## Button Styling

### Problem
Buttons had inconsistent styling across the site.

### Solution
1. Applied the Unified button system throughout the site
2. Ensured consistent button styles with proper contrast
3. Updated Hero buttons to match the design system
