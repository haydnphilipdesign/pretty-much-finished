# Text Contrast Fixes - Simplified Approach

## What was fixed:

1. **Text Visibility on Service Page Light Backgrounds**
   - Fixed contrast issues for text on light backgrounds
   - Made headings dark navy/black for maximum readability
   - Made paragraph text dark gray for better contrast

2. **Card Text Visibility**
   - Made card backgrounds solid blue instead of transparent
   - Set all card text to white for maximum contrast
   - Removed problematic transparent effects that caused text to blend with backgrounds

3. **Navigation and Header Text**
   - Made all navigation links white with proper weight
   - Fixed header text to be pure white on blue backgrounds
   - Enhanced button contrast for clear visibility

4. **Section Heading Positioning**
   - Fixed positioning issues with section headers
   - Ensured proper spacing between headings and content
   - Corrected z-index issues that might have caused headings to be hidden

5. **Removed Decorative Elements**
   - Removed all gradient and decorative effects
   - Simplified backgrounds to solid colors
   - Focused purely on text readability

## The Approach:

This simplified approach focuses purely on text visibility without any decorative elements. We've:

1. Used solid background colors instead of gradients or transparencies
2. Applied high-contrast color combinations (dark text on light backgrounds, white text on dark backgrounds)
3. Fixed positioning issues with headers and content
4. Removed any effects that might interfere with text readability

These changes ensure that all text is clearly visible against its background across all pages of the site.
