# Hero and Navigation Improvements

This document outlines the changes made to standardize the page heroes and improve the navigation experience.

## Page Hero Standardization

### Changes Made

1. **Consistent Hero Structure**
   - All page heroes now match the styling of the Home page hero
   - Standardized text placement (left-aligned on desktop, center-aligned on mobile)
   - Consistent glass card layout in the right column
   - Added `data-page-transitioning-content="true"` marker for better transition handling

2. **Unified Glass Card Styling**
   - Updated all hero glass cards to use `glass-card-navy` with proper padding
   - Ensured consistent content layout inside glass cards
   - Maintained page-specific content while standardizing the presentation

3. **Animation Consistency**
   - Made entrance and exit animations match across all pages
   - Ensured smooth transitions between pages with proper opacity and movement

## Navigation Improvements

### Changes Made

1. **Precise Timing Settings**
   - Set `scrollDuration` to exactly 400ms as requested
   - Set `heroVisibilityDelay` to exactly 300ms as requested
   - These settings ensure smooth scrolling while providing enough time to see the hero before navigation

2. **Fixed Scroll Position Issues**
   - Created a specialized `ScrollToTopLink` component specifically for header navigation
   - Updated all header links to use this component, ensuring they always reset scroll position
   - Added multiple scroll resets at various stages of the navigation process:
     * On link click
     * Before navigation starts
     * After navigation completes
     * During page render via a MutationObserver

3. **Multi-layered Approach**
   - Modified `SmoothLink` component to reset scroll position before AND after navigation
   - Enhanced `useNavigationScroll` hook with more aggressive scroll position monitoring
   - Added scroll reset in the PageTransition component using a MutationObserver
   - This multi-layered approach ensures scroll position is always correctly reset

## Technical Implementation

### New Components

1. **ScrollToTopLink**
   - A specialized Link component for header navigation
   - Forcefully resets scroll position before and after navigation
   - Adds state flags to signal other components to also reset scroll

2. **Enhanced PageTransition**
   - Added MutationObserver to detect DOM changes and reset scroll position
   - Uses multiple requestAnimationFrame calls to ensure scroll position is reset

3. **Improved useNavigationScroll Hook**
   - More aggressive scroll position monitoring
   - Uses a previous path reference to detect actual navigation
   - Multiple scroll resets to ensure proper positioning

## Usage Guidelines

To ensure consistent hero presentation across pages:

1. **Page Hero Structure**
   - Use the `PageHeroWrapper` component for all page heroes
   - Provide a `title` and `subtitle` for consistent heading structure
   - Include a `pageType` for appropriate glass card content

2. **Example Implementation**
   ```jsx
   <PageHeroWrapper
     title="Your Page Title"
     subtitle="Your page subtitle text here"
     pageType="about" // or another relevant type
   >
     {/* Action buttons go here */}
     <YourButtonComponent />
   </PageHeroWrapper>
   ```

3. **Navigation Behavior**
   - The site now provides a consistent navigation experience:
     1. Smooth scroll to top (400ms duration)
     2. Brief pause showing the hero (300ms delay)
     3. Navigation to new page, starting at the top

These changes create a more cohesive and professional user experience across the entire site.
